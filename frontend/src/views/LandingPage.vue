              FreeRooms is a tool helping UNSW students find their dream study
              location within the campus. We have many features on the way,
              including a map with the real-time availabilities of each room in a
              UNSW building. It was created by CSESoc Projects - a place for
              student-led projects where you can learn something new and make some
              friends along the way. FreeRooms is free and open-source.

            How it works:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Click on a building you want to study at and the availabilities of different rooms in that building will be listed on the page.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you want to see the availability of the room over a week, click on the calendar icon next to the room.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you want to plan your university day, you can change the time and day to see the availability of rooms in the future.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

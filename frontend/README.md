# Freerooms Frontend

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Installation Guide

The package manager used is [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), which should already be there if you've installed Node.

Once installed, you can run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage Guide

Before running the frontend, you must **first** run [the backend](../backend).

You can run the frontend with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

During development, you should run the frontend in dev mode instead:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.

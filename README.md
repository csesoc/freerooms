# Freerooms by CSESoc

🥾Have you ever wandered around campus, searching for an empty study room?🚪 Have you ever wanted to study somewhere other than the weird smelling ASB🏢, the loud corridors of Ainsworth 🏦 or the poorly decorated main library? 📚 If you are a director or exec, have you ever wanted to find a room for your in-person meetings or society event? Whether you're in need of a quiet study nook or a large space for your society's next big event, Freerooms has got you covered!

🌐💡 We embrace the latest technologies to make Freerooms the best platform out there:
- React/Next.js (frontend)
- React Native (mobile app)
- Node/Express (backend)
- TypeScript (everything)
and more! 🤓👨‍💻

You can find a live build of Freerooms at [https://freerooms.csesoc.app](https://freerooms.csesoc.app/).
